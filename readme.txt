	Description: This project implements a simple line drawing software. Given a list of line endpoints
	and colors, it draws the lines in those specific colors. This can be used to draw pictures.
	Line coordinates and colors are provided in txt files, and the code parses the files to draw
	the figures.
	
	A few reference figures are available in shape1.txt, shape2.txt, shape3.txt, shape4.txt. The code
	initially asks for a text file for input. Use any of those 4, and the corresponding figure is drawn.
	Further, once drawn, the figure can be moved by clicking and dragging. Spacebar resets the figure.
	
	This project is implemented as a solution to a problem set. Detailed description of the problem
	is available in ProblemSet08.pdf. The implemented code is available in ps8.cpp, and reference figures are
	available in shape1.txt, shape2.txt, shape3.txt, shape4.txt.
	
	Code practices to note: Various classes have been used to build the solution. Note use of OOP
	practices for simplicity and reusability.
